# Excel-Project

The purpose of the project was to create a table showing the top 20 countries' GDPs using only 2019 data.
First I filtered the data to show only data from 2019:

Then I filtered the results by rank to show the top 20 rows but some of the top 20 were removed because the data in those rows were from other years, I needed the first 31 rows of the whole table to get the top 20 rows from 2019.:

I created a chart to display the data:
